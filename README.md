### Date created
May 4, 2024

### Project Title
Python Data Analysis Tool

### Description
This project is a simple data analysis tool implemented in Python. It includes a Python script (`analysis.py`) that loads a dataset from a CSV file and performs basic statistical analysis using the pandas library. The script provides summary statistics such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for numerical columns in the dataset. It serves as a starting point for analyzing datasets using Python.

### Files used
- `analysis.py`: Python script for data analysis
- `dataset.csv`: Sample dataset containing data for analysis

### Credits
The code for this project was inspired by various Python data analysis tutorials and documentation on pandas library. The official documentation of pandas library served as a valuable resource during the implementation.
